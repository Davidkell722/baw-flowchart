                <h2>Background Information</h2>
                <p>Ankle sprains are common injuries that occur when the ligaments that support the ankle stretch beyond their limits and tear. Ankle sprains can range from mild to severe, depending upon how much damage there is to the ligaments.</p>

            <h2>Brendan's Clinical Preference</h2>
            <p>For the treatment of ankle sprains, Brendan's approach typically includes prescribing a CAM boot immobilization for 4 weeks. Given that patients usually present some time after the injury, he then advises a 2-week period to transition back to full activities, without a routine follow-up appointment.</p>

            <h2>Templates to Use</h2>
            <p>When documenting cases of ankle sprains, the recommended template is <strong>LOWEREXT_FX</strong>. Although the radiographic reading is likely to be "No obvious signs of an acute fracture," it is crucial to always verify this finding. For follow-up notes, use the shorthand <code>.prn</code>.</p>
